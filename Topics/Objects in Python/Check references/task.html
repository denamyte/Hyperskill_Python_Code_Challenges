<div class="step-text">

<p>Imagine, you have two variables and you don't know what they contain but need to check if they refer to the same object or not. How would you do that?</p>
<p>Write a function <code class="java">check(obj1, obj2)</code> that will take two objects and <u>print</u> <code class="java">True</code> if they refer to the same object and <code class="java">False</code> otherwise.</p><br><br><font color="gray">Memory limit: 256 MB</font><br><font color="gray">Time limit: 15 seconds</font><br><br>
