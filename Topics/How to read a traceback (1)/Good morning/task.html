<h2>Good morning</h2>
<div class="step-text">
<p></p>
<p>Jo likes to start the morning with a good mood, so he wrote the following function for himself:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">def good_morning(name):
    print("Good morning, ", + name)

good_morning("Jo")</code></pre>
<p>But when trying to call the function, he saw an error message:</p>
<pre><code class="language-no-highlight">Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "C:/Users/laysa/PycharmProjects/untitled/file.py", line 8, in &amp;lt;module&amp;gt;
    good_morning("Jo")
  File "C:/Users/laysa/PycharmProjects/untitled/file.py", line 6, in good_morning
    print("Good morning, ", + name)
TypeError: bad operand type for unary +: 'str'</code></pre>
<p>Our task is to disassemble the resulting traceback into parts and find a suitable description for each block.</p>
