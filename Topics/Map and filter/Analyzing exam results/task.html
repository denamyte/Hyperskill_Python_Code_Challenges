<h2>Analyzing exam results</h2>
<div class="step-text">
<p></p>
<p>Imagine you work at the admission office of some university, and you need to select successful applications for the next academic year.</p>
<p>All candidates took entry exams in Maths, Physics, and English. Results are stored in the lists <code class="java">scores_maths</code>,  <code class="java">scores_physics</code> and <code class="java">scores_english</code> respectively.</p>
<p>To enter the university, a student must get <em>at least</em> 270 points in total.</p>
<p>How many students will be admitted?</p>
<p>[HINT] First, compute the overall score for each student. Then, filter out those who didn't get enough points and print the length of the remaining list.[/HINT]</p><br><br><font color="gray">Memory limit: 256 MB</font><br><font color="gray">Time limit: 15 seconds</font><br><br>
