<h2>Name confusion</h2>
<div class="step-text">
<p></p>
<p>Imagine you helped organize a conference and printed everyone's name badges. People's names and surnames are stored in different variables. However, you confused the first name and the surname of one of the guests.</p>
<p>To correct the mistake, you need to swap the values of the variables <code class="java">name</code> and <code class="java">surname</code>. Write a part of code to do that and remember that Python allows you to swap two variables without a third one.</p><br><br><font color="gray">Memory limit: 256 MB</font><br><font color="gray">Time limit: 15 seconds</font><br><br>
