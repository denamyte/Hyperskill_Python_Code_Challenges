<h2>Addition with condition</h2>
<div class="step-text">

<p></p><div class="alert alert-warning">Whoa! This problem is more complex than the previous ones and requires knowledge of the <strong>if statement</strong>. If you're feeling up to the challenge, brace yourself and good luck! Otherwise, you can skip it for now and return any time later.</div>
<p> </p>
<p>As you know, when we add an array and a list, the latter is treated also as an array. However, we may not want the addition to return the same result for a list and an array as it does for two arrays, because an argument being a list instead of an array might be a mistake.</p>
<p>Write a function that will take two arguments:</p>
<ol>
<li>two arrays,</li>
<li>an array and a list,</li>
<li>two lists.</li>
</ol>
<p>In the first case, sum them and return the result. In the second case, return a string with the warning <code class="java">One argument is a list</code>, and in the last case, return <code class="java">Both arguments are lists, not arrays</code>.</p>
<p>All lists and arrays will be one-dimensional and of the same size.</p>
<p><b>Tip:</b> You can check the variable type by calling <code class="java">isinstance(arg, type)</code>, which will return a boolean indicating whether the <code class="java">arg</code> has the specified <code class="java">type</code>. You can also use the <code class="java">type()</code> for type checking as mentioned in theory. </p><br><br><font color="gray">Memory limit: 256 MB</font><br><font color="gray">Time limit: 15 seconds</font><br><br>
