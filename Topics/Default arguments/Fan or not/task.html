<h2>Fan or not</h2>
<div class="step-text">
<p></p>
<p>A bunch of friends got together to watch an esports tournament. Some of them have already decided on their favorite team and there are some who are interested in watching the competition only.</p>
<p>Your task is to implement the <code class="java">add_viewer()</code> function:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The function should take two arguments: a person's <code class="java">name</code> and, optionally, the current <code class="java">fan_list</code> (if a person does not have a favorite team yet, this argument should not be passed to the function).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the <code class="java">fan_list</code> variable is passed to the function, the <code class="java">name</code> of the person should be added to the provided<code class="java">fan_list</code>, then this list should be returned.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the person is not a fan of any particular team, an empty list for non-fans should be created, the <code class="java">name</code> of the person should be added there, and the list should be returned.  </p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Let's look at example:</p>
<p>1. A string <code class="java">Mark VP</code> was passed to the function, then the output will be <code class="java">['Mark']</code>, and this will be stored as <code class="java">fan_list</code>.</p>
<p>2.  A string <code class="java">Molly</code> is passed to the function and she isn't a fan, so the list is not passed to the function. Then the function should return the list <code class="java">["Molly"]</code>.</p>
<p>3. A string <code class="java">Harry Alliance</code> was passed to the function, then the output will be <code class="java">['Mark', 'Harry']</code>, because they are fans.</p>
<p>You do <em>NOT</em> need to handle input or call the function, just implement it.</p><br><br><font color="gray">Memory limit: 256 MB</font><br><font color="gray">Time limit: 15 seconds</font><br><br>
