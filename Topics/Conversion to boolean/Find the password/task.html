<p>Imagine that you are a hacker and you have got access to a web server written in Python. The problem is that it asks for a password that you do not know. However, this server is open source so you know that there is the <code class="language-python">wrong_password()</code> function which takes a password and checks it against <code class="language-python">real_password</code>.</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">def wrong_password(password):
    return (password == "" or (not password and real_password)) or password != real_password</code></pre>
<p>You can not access the <code class="language-python">real_password</code> variable but you can call the <code class="language-python">wrong_password()</code> function and exploit its vulnerability to obtain the password. Write your code inside the <code class="language-python">solve()</code> function. Think about an argument that can be passed to the <code class="language-python">wrong_password()</code> function so that the function returns the <code class="language-python">real_password</code>. <strong>Print</strong> the result of the <code class="language-python">wrong_password()</code> function.</p>
<p>Your program should not read any input or call the <code class="language-python">solve()</code> function, your task is to implement it.</p>
<p><b>Tip:</b> Remember that "and" and "or" operators return one of their operands. Refer to the tables showing which operands the operators return in different cases.</p><br><br><font color="gray">Memory limit: 256 MB</font><br><font color="gray">Time limit: 15 seconds</font><br><br>
