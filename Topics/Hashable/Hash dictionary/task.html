<p>Write a program that creates <strong>a dictionary</strong> of objects as <strong>keys</strong> and their hash values as <strong>values</strong>. Objects are stored in the list <code class="java">objects</code>. The resulting dictionary should be called <code class="java">objects_dict</code>. Do not print anything!</p>
<p>Some objects in the <code class="java">objects</code> list may be unhashable. This means that you cannot calculate their hash values and add them as dictionary keys. Make sure to skip such objects when creating the <code class="java">objects_dict</code>!</p>
<p><b>Tip:</b> You can either directly check if an object is hashable or not or handle exceptions.</p><br><br><font color="gray">Memory limit: 256 MB</font><br><font color="gray">Time limit: 15 seconds</font><br><br>
